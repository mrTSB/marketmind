  "summary": "The Indian American documentary market, valued at $120 million in 2024 with a 6% annual growth rate projecting over $160 million by 2029, targets culturally proud, educated adults aged 25-54 across key U.S. states, driven by rising demand for diverse diaspora narratives and streaming platform consumption. Despite challenges like limited authentic representation, funding constraints, and distribution barriers, opportunities abound through emerging trends such as interactive storytelling, VR experiences, and community partnerships, supported by influential filmmakers and media outlets. Navigating complex regulatory environments and addressing gaps in accessibility and mainstream engagement remain critical for sustaining growth and impactful storytelling in this niche cultural segment."
