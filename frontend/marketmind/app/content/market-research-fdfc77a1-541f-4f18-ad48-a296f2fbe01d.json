  "summary": "The Chinese American documentary market, valued at $12.3 billion in 2024 with a 5.3% growth rate, targets culturally engaged, socially conscious audiences across key U.S. regions who seek authentic, multi-dimensional narratives beyond stereotypical portrayals. Despite rising demand driven by streaming platforms and social justice themes, challenges persist in funding, distribution, and bilingual content, with significant opportunities to leverage new media, creator-community collaborations, and technology for wider impact. Influential voices like Frank H. Wu and platforms such as CAAMedia play vital roles in shaping and expanding this culturally critical storytelling space."
